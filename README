Skeleton Zend Framework Application (version: 1.11.11) which includes the following:

- ACL configuration using a MySQL database to store access rules and permissions.
  - supports inheritance
  - fine grained access to controller actions by group or individual
- Authentication which works with ACL
  - username and password login
  - Password salt used to create a more secure password
  - Forgot password action (action created but not implemented in GUI)
- Implementation of Zend Dojo Container object for page layout
- Implementation of Zend Dojo Forms
- Implementation of JQuery for menus and data tables
- Implementation of MySQL Database access with example queries

I am not an expert in any way at using the Zend Framework and there were many shortcuts taken when developing this skeleton. 

So please feel free to ask questions and make adjustments where necessary so that others can benefit.
